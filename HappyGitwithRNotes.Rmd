### <ins>Appendix A: The Shell</ins>

Shell (pseudo-synonyms: terminal, command line, console)
  - a program on your computer whose job it is to run other programs.

Bash
  - most common shell, sometimes used as a proxy

HappyGit shells are used for tasks like
  - navigating the file system
  - doing Git operations that we don't want or can't use RStudio for
Can be less ambiguous and perishable than graphical user interfaces (GUIs)

Starting a Shell from RStudio
  Tools > *Terminal* launches in RStudio (most typical/"useful")
  Tools > *Shell* launches in an external window

### <ins> Basic Shell Commands </ins>
Excerpt from Textbook
pwd (print working directory). Shows directory or “folder” you are currently operating in. This is not necessarily the same as the R working directory you get from getwd().
ls (list files). Shows the files in the current working directory. This is equivalent to looking at the files in your Finder/Explorer/File Manager. Use ls -a to also list hidden files, such as .Rhistory and .git.
cd (change directory). Allows you to navigate through your directories by changing the shell’s working directory. You can navigate like so:
go to subdirectory foo of current working directory: cd foo
go to parent of current working directory: cd ..
go to your “home” directory: cd ~ or simply cd
go to directory using absolute path, works regardless of your current working directory: cd /home/my_username/Desktop. Windows uses a slightly different syntax with the slashes between the folder names reversed, \, e.g. cd C:\Users\MY_USERNAME\Desktop.
Pro tip 1: Dragging and dropping a file or folder into the terminal window will paste the absolute path into the window.
Pro tip 2: Use the tab key to autocomplete unambiguous directory and file names. Hit tab twice to see all ambiguous options.
Use arrow-up and arrow-down to repeat previous commands. Or search for previous commands with CTRL + r.
A few Git commands:
git status is the most used git command and informs you of your current branch, any changes or untracked files, and whether you are in sync with your remotes.
git remote -v lists all remotes. Very useful for making sure git knows about your remote and that the remote address is correct.
git remote add origin GITHUB_URL adds the remote GITHUB_URL with nickname origin.
git remote set-url origin GITHUB_URL changes the remote url of origin to GITHUB_URL. This way you can fix typos in the remote url.
