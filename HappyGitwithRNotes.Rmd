### <ins>Appendix A: The Shell</ins>

Shell (pseudo-synonyms: terminal, command line, console)
  - a program on your computer whose job it is to run other programs.

Bash
  - most common shell, sometimes used as a proxy

HappyGit shells are used for tasks like
  - navigating the file system
  - doing Git operations that we don't want or can't use RStudio for
Can be less ambiguous and perishable than graphical user interfaces (GUIs)

Starting a Shell from RStudio
  Tools > *Terminal* launches in RStudio (most typical/"useful")
  Tools > *Shell* launches in an external window

### <ins> Basic Shell Commands </ins>
Excerpt from Textbook
pwd (print working directory). Shows directory or “folder” you are currently operating in. This is not necessarily the same as the R working directory you get from getwd().
ls (list files). Shows the files in the current working directory. This is equivalent to looking at the files in your Finder/Explorer/File Manager. Use ls -a to also list hidden files, such as .Rhistory and .git.
cd (change directory). Allows you to navigate through your directories by changing the shell’s working directory. You can navigate like so:
go to subdirectory foo of current working directory: cd foo
go to parent of current working directory: cd ..
go to your “home” directory: cd ~ or simply cd
go to directory using absolute path, works regardless of your current working directory: cd /home/my_username/Desktop. Windows uses a slightly different syntax with the slashes between the folder names reversed, \, e.g. cd C:\Users\MY_USERNAME\Desktop.
Pro tip 1: Dragging and dropping a file or folder into the terminal window will paste the absolute path into the window.
Pro tip 2: Use the tab key to autocomplete unambiguous directory and file names. Hit tab twice to see all ambiguous options.
Use arrow-up and arrow-down to repeat previous commands. Or search for previous commands with CTRL + r.
A few Git commands:
git status is the most used git command and informs you of your current branch, any changes or untracked files, and whether you are in sync with your remotes.
git remote -v lists all remotes. Very useful for making sure git knows about your remote and that the remote address is correct.
git remote add origin GITHUB_URL adds the remote GITHUB_URL with nickname origin.
git remote set-url origin GITHUB_URL changes the remote url of origin to GITHUB_URL. This way you can fix typos in the remote url.

### <ins> Chapter 7: Introduce yourself to Git </ins>
In the shell: 
git config --global user.name "Jane Doe"
git config --global user.email "jane@example.com"
git config --global --list

sub in name and **email associated with your GitHub account**

### <ins> Chapter 8: Install a Git Client (high recommend) </ins>
Use of a GUI opposed to command is extermely helpful, especially when getting started

Git is really just individual commands executed in the shell, which can be unappealing. You may prefer to do Git operation via a client with a GUI.
RStudio offer a very basic Git client via its Git pane. While this is good for simple operations, it is recommended to also install a more powerful one.

n.b. you may have to use the command line for some things

### <ins> Chapter 9: Personal access token for HTTPS </ins>
Allows communication with a remote server to prove we are a specific GitHub user
You can use SSH also, but HTTPS is recommend
Setting up a personal access token (PAT)

Go to [GitHub Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and click "Generate token."

to do this from R:
  usethis::create_github_token()
Copy PAT as you will not be able to come back for it, you will provide it next time a Git operation asks for your password

You can get out of this by storing the PAT explicity in R
  gitcreds::gitcreds_set()

  ? Enter password or token:                    ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
-> Adding new credentials…
-> Removing credentials from cache…
-> Done.

You should now be able to work with GitHub now (push/pull) Yay!

### <ins> Chapter 11: Connect to GitHub
Push/Pull to GitHub from my computer
Create a repo if it does not already exist
Near “Repositories”, click the big green “New” button. Or, if you are on your own profile page, click on “Repositories”, then click the big green “New” button. Fill this as desired.

Copy a clone URL to your clipboard, preferrably if following this it would be the HTTPS URL.

<ins> Clone the repo to your local computer </ins>
Using command line Git
  - go to shell
  - note directory (pwd displays working directory, cd changes directory)
  - clone repo from GitHub to computer using
git clone
https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
  - the https://… should match the https://… url

add a line to README and verify Git notices the change:
echo "A line I wrote on my local computer  " >> README.md
git status

### <ins> Chapter 12: Connect RStudio to Git and Github </ins>

Verifies RStudio can issue Git commands for you. If you succeed, it means your setup is DONE.

Prereqs:
  - registered a GitHub account (chapter 4)
  - installed/updated R and R Studio (chapter 5)
  - installed Git (chapter 6)
  - can push pull for GitHub to the command line (chapter 11)
